# Master prompt: Finding Naresh — Bessi and the 5 Roses (continue to completion)

You are taking over an in-progress Godot 4.7 game project from a previous session.
Read this whole file (`notes/MASTER_PROMPT.md`) first, then `DESIGN.md` (the agreed story arc, world, creatures and
the professional build process with gyms; it supersedes the original spec's plan),
`notes/TODO.md` (live progress; its "Right now" line says exactly where work stopped),
`notes/LESSONS.md` (what to do and not to do: read it, and add to it as you learn),
`notes/PRINCIPLES.md` (how the user wants the work done: first principles, never
assume an untested limit, the algorithm; also in `CLAUDE.md`),
`notes/POLISH.md` (agreed changes for after the milestones),
`README.md`, `FUTURE.md`, `CREDITS.md`, `design/map_plan_v1.png`, and only then the
original spec `Finding_Naresh_Game_Demo_Build_Prompt.md`, all in
`D:\mine\Agentics\T3_Code_Works\MPG`. Then continue from section 6. Everything below
is established fact unless it says otherwise.

**This file is kept current** (rule 11): it is updated whenever a part is finished and
tested, so a new session (any model) can resume if the previous one ran out.
Last updated: 2026-09-29, Milestone E (Naresh and Bessi, E1-E7) done and
approved by the user part by part (each with its decisions, "for now"); E8
the full run and the push.
Milestones A-E are done, approved by the user and pushed. The user is here:
one part at a time, their test before each push (rule 2). Next: Milestone F
(the return), whose open questions (`design/RETURN.md`) must be discussed
with the user before anything is built.
Start at section 6.

## 1. The project in one paragraph

A two-player, local split-screen, first-person co-op road-trip adventure. Two friends
drive a battered camper van to find Naresh, who vanished on his way to "Bessi and the
5 Roses" with a "friend" nobody ever met (the twist: the friend was imaginary, left
ambiguous). Half driving and van upkeep (fuel, heat, coolant, tyres, battery, cargo),
half on-foot exploration, co-op puzzles, paper-map navigation, physics comedy.
Creatures you hide from (no killing; a hidden flare gun scares them off). Target: a
polished demo (the 30-minute cap is relaxed: up to ~3 h is fine, pacing matters),
Windows PC, keyboard + mouse for P1 and a controller for P2. The full story arc is in
`DESIGN.md`. Engine: Godot 4.7.1, GDScript, everything built
in code (no hand-made scenes beyond `scenes/Main.tscn` running `Boot.gd`).

GitHub: <https://github.com/sriram403/Band5R> (branch `main`). **Push only as
the `sriram403` account, never `sriram-lexbolt`** (both are in this PC's
credential manager; the repo's local git config pins
`credential.https://github.com.username = sriram403`; check it before a push). The user is
**sriram**; refer to them as "the user"/"you", pronouns
they/them.

## 2. Status right now (2026-09-29)

- **Stage 1** (prototype + feel pass) and **Milestone A** (homestead -> road trip ->
  water works -> broken bridge): done, approved, pushed.
- **Design agreed and pushed** in `DESIGN.md`: two homes + split tutorial, the way out
  teaching every mechanic, Bessi = an empty dusk beach inspired by Besant Nagar
  (Elliot's) Beach with the Five Roses rising from supernatural smoke (Naresh in the
  fifth), the return by a different road with Naresh (creatures follow him; he can be
  taken), Naresh's home + hidden tracker, the sunny drive home and the LiveStander
  teaser. Colour/mood curve bright -> grey -> dark -> bright. No health system: being
  caught separates you. Art stays block-out until a polish stage at the very end.
- **Small fixes** (ESC, handbrake, brakes, wheels, seated pose, van hits player,
  engine/pour/nature sounds, horizon ridges): done, 171 play-test checks pass,
  **approved and pushed** (main at `603fe46`).
- **Milestone B (foundations)**: done, approved and pushed (2026-09-24):
  - map plan v1 (`design/map_plan_v1.png`, `tools/gen/map_plan.py`) approved;
  - gyms done: `world/GymBuilder.gd` (`base` gym), `-- --gym=<name>`,
    `GYM=base tools/run_test.sh`, scenario `t_gym`; `Landscape.height_fn` lets a gym
    define its own ground; `Boot.gym_request` ("?" = none, "" = world) survives a
    scene reload;
  - developer menu done: `dev/DevMenu.gd` (F1), scenario `t_dev`;
  - chunked terrain done: `Landscape.build_terrain()` makes 250 m tiles (near 5 m
    mesh, far 20 m mesh with skirts, `visibility_range` switch at 800 m); world size
    is `Landscape.EXTENT` (static var, set by the builder; `--extent=<m>` override,
    `ARGS="--extent=4000" tools/run_test.sh perf` for load tests). 4 km: 144 fps,
    4.8 s build;
  - beat chart v1 (`design/BEAT_CHART.md`) **approved** ("happy");
  - mirrors + nav swing (user request) done: `Camper._build_mirrors()` (two door
    mirrors + rear-view: SubViewport cameras looking back, texture flipped on a quad,
    rendered only while someone is seated, round-robin one mirror every 2nd rendered
    frame from `Camper._process`; costs ~14 fps: 144 -> ~130 with both views
    driving). `Camper.swing_nav()` / `nav_aside` (N key, pad A, either seat): the nav
    label moves to the driver's private visual layer so only the passenger's camera
    draws it. Scenario `t_mirrors`;
  - full play-test after mirrors: 180 checks, 0 failures, ~130 fps;
  - **4 x 4 km greybox done** (second thread): layout data in `LevelLayout.gd`
    consts (was `LevelBuilder.gd`), mirrored in `tools/gen/layout_check.py` (checks grades/cuts/gaps,
    `--draw` makes `design/greybox_layout.png`). Roads: home_lane (homestead ->
    town -> P2 -> J1), valley_road, ridge_track, pump_house_road (J2 -> bridge ->
    J3), ghat_road (2 hairpins to the pass), beach_road (-> bessi_loop around the
    roses by the beach), coast_road (Bessi -> fishing village, salt pans, estuary
    bridge, under Tunnel Hill -> Naresh's home), west_road (-> homestead),
    tower_road (west_road -> ending watchtower -> P2). Sea + beach east, trees
    tiled, world builds ~7 s. Fixed an old bug: terrain triangles faced down
    (ground lit from below); albedo 0.6 keeps the approved brightness.
  - full suite on the new map: 180 checks pass (after fixing a lake-sound and
    two test-placement issues).
  - every road driven and timed (`tools/run_test.sh routes`, not in the default
    list; 16 min of driving at ~60 km/h). Fuel use lowered (FUEL_PER_KM 2.5).
  - **Milestone B approved by the user ("tested all good") and pushed.**
- The plan for B-G, with sub-steps, is in `notes/TODO.md`.
- **Cloud PRs #1–#6 reviewed and merged into `main` (2026-09-24):** #1 added
  Linux headless tests and GitHub CI; #4 fixed nine bugs (including the steam
  cloud and controller disconnect) and added `notes/CODE_REVIEW.md`; #5 made
  world building about 1.5 times faster with identical generated world data;
  #6 split LevelBuilder into five files without intended behavior changes;
  #2 added valve B's two kick-backs and `design/PUZZLES.md`; #3 added five
  design proposal pages for D/E/F, creatures and Naresh. A follow-up to #6
  fixed the layout test for a connected P2 pad and restored its starting layout.
  All six GitHub PRs are closed as merged. Local `main` was pulled after #3.
  The last complete windowed run, on the #2 preview with the pad connected,
  recorded **191 passes, 0 failures**. The #3 docs-only preview was stopped
  after 161 passes, 0 failures because a full gameplay run was unnecessary.
  The valve B feel remains a human judgment; the user chose the automated
  result only for this review. Treat the new design pages as proposals, not
  approved implementation decisions.
- **Three test levels done locally (2026-09-25, not pushed):** scenario timing
  added to `PlayTest.gd`. Baseline old suite: 951 seconds of scenarios, zero
  failures (`journey` 488 s, `waterworks` 91 s, `lap` 69 s). Default
  `tools/run_test.sh` now runs basic mechanic checks in the base gym, then
  teleported world checks: Quick 265 s (~4.5 min), zero failures, no script
  errors. `tools/run_test.sh full` runs the gym plus the old broad world suite
  and all eight roads: 2010 s (~33.5 min), zero failures, no script errors.
  `python tools/gen/layout_check.py` takes ~2 s, "no problems". A screenshot
  review found the fading control reminder over the objective in split view;
  it was moved to bottom right and checked on foot and in both seats (0
  failures). Current local commits are beyond the merged cloud PRs; do not
  push before the user's milestone approval.
- **Milestone C started:** `notes/TODO.md` has the approved opening's detailed
  checklist. The tyre gym has a fixed trap, a physical spare-wheel swap, flat
  handling and a 20% handbrake slope. Its 17 checks pass in 33.5 s; the
  default Quick repeat including it finished with zero failures and script
  errors. The world puncture is after Town Fuel; its story-gated teleport
  check passes (three checks). The house gym then passed 15 checks: battery
  search and torch, doors, shed, full can, real stair walk and window sightline.
  The same house now replaces P2's world block, and Town Fuel has a working
  pump; seven world checks pass. Traffic gym passed three obstruction checks;
  four cars are placed on the town lane and six world checks pass. P2's drive
  measures 20.9%, holds the van with the handbrake and rolls it without one;
  the terrain joins the slab and its screenshot was inspected. The default
  Quick repeat across all three opening gyms, base gym and world passed with
  zero failures and no script errors. The phone, per-player objectives, split
  start, pick-up and save/load of the opening followed.
- **Milestone C review (2026-09-25, Claude):** eleven fixes to the earlier
  work, listed in `notes/TODO.md` under "Review fixes" (controller journal
  button, Town Fuel off the road, town cars jamming, gym crash, tyre and nail
  visuals, phone redesign, test helper bugs). `opening_full` plays the whole
  opening with the real controls: see TODO.md for its timing. The user's test
  then found P2's house unusable (stairs, doors, drive lip) and the nails
  gated behind the refuel; fixed, `opening_p2` added to Quick (P2 walked for
  real), and Milestone C was approved and pushed.
- **Milestone D (the way out) done:**
  the way-out and creature pages were approved with every recommended answer.
  Gyms done, each with its own test, all in Quick: `tagging` (T / MMB / RT,
  a pin both players see, 200 m, 20 s), `binoculars` (pick-up, RMB / LT 4x),
  `stealth` (creature sight, hearing, suspicion, chase; being taken to a drop
  point; the cardboard box, peeking, thrown lures) and `creature` (the van:
  engine/door/horn noises, the staged attack, the tarp). Then D5 traffic
  (table-driven, `world/Traffic.gd`, the one `Lorry`) and D6 the mood curve
  (`world/Mood.gd`). Metrics are in `DESIGN.md` 6.1. D7 the windmill brake
  (`puzzles/WindmillBrake.gd`, `world/Ladder.gd`, `t_windmill`, saved) done.
  D8 the power line (`puzzles/PowerLine.gd`, bridge hut, `t_power`) done.
  D9 the lift bridge (`puzzles/LiftBridge.gd`, `t_bridge`) and D10 the ghat
  (`world/Ghat.gd`: fog, pace notes, glimpse, first attack; `t_ghat`) done.
  D11 the coast watchtower (`world/CoastWatch.gd`, `t_tower`) and D12
  (`puzzles/BarnMaze.gd`, `puzzles/LookoutRelay.gd`, `t_maze`, `t_relay`)
  done. D13 `t_way_out` (Full only) drives J1 -> the watchtower on both
  routes. Full: 525 checks (1 fixed and rerun); Quick 436, 0 failures.
  **Pushed 2026-09-26 at the user's request (main `43df9fa`)**; the user's own
  test (`notes/TEST_MILESTONE_D.md`) is pending: the windmill was checked
  ("like it"), the rest not yet.
  The tarp and the cardboard box are block-outs awaiting the user's look
  approval.
- **Milestone E started (2026-09-27, new thread):** the command key chosen by
  the user: **V / D-pad Up**. E1 built: `naresh/Naresh.gd` (follow, wait, go,
  carry, store, refuel, hold, work, get in / out of the van's bench, the
  scripted refuel mistake, nine random acts every 3-6 min announced 3 s
  before and never in a `naresh_calm` zone, taken when alone by a creature
  and left high up 200-400 m off, shouting until fetched, knocked by the van,
  save / load), `world/Workable.gd` (hold / work things), the command wheel
  (`PlayerRig`, `ui/CommandWheel.gd`), his subtitles (`PlayerHUD`), the
  `naresh` gym, F1 rows, `t_naresh` (0 failures, ~5 min). set:gyms 21
  scenarios 0 failures. **Approved by the user and pushed (2026-09-27).**
- **Milestone E done (2026-09-27 to 29), each part approved and pushed**
  (test sheets and decisions: `notes/TEST_MILESTONE_E.md`):
  E2 the Bessi beach (`world/Bessi.gd`; promenade, stall lights, the radio
  tune `tools/gen/radio.py`, the memorial on the photo line, lighthouse, the
  nav's NO SIGNAL); E3 the photo (`world/Alignment.gd`, `core/PhotoCamera.gd`:
  line up two landmarks within 2 m, the photo goes to P2's phone); E4 the
  roses (`world/Roses.gd`: sunk until the photo spot is found, smoke, they
  rise, carvings, Naresh sitting in the fifth); E5 the evidence
  (`world/Evidence.gd`: his camp, footprints for one, packing up); E6 the
  store and the boat (`world/BessiTasks.gd`, `items/FuelDrum.gd`: batteries
  from the rolled-up store, the 40 L drum under an upturned boat that needs
  three pairs of hands, Naresh on the wrong side first); E7 the storm
  (`world/StormFront.gd`: a black bank over the Beach Road, rain, lightning,
  thunder `tools/gen/thunder.py`; the roses sink; "my friend says we should
  go north"; Bessi ends on the coast road north with Naresh in the back).
  F1 → Story jumps to any Bessi step set the world up (`Story._bessi_state_for`)
  and put both players, Naresh and the van at the step (`DevMenu.go_to_step`).
  Tests: `set:bessi` (11 scenarios), `t_bessi_save`, `t_bessi_run` (Full).
- **Working in two copies (user, 2026-09-27):** `MPG` runs the long tests,
  `../MPG_dev` (a git worktree, branch per part) builds the next part at the
  same time; two game instances measured fine (112 vs 144 fps). The user's
  principles: `notes/PRINCIPLES.md`, `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## 3. Rules the user has set (follow exactly)

1. **Nothing on the C: drive.** All tools, downloads, caches, user data stay inside the
   MPG folder on D:. Godot's `user://` is rooted at `%APPDATA%`; `Play.bat`,
   `OpenEditor.bat` and `tools/run_game.sh` set `APPDATA`/`LOCALAPPDATA` to
   `MPG\appdata`. **Always launch Godot through `tools/run_game.sh` (from a shell) or
   the .bat files, never the exe directly.** `config/custom_user_dir_name` alone does
   NOT move user data off C: (it appends under %APPDATA%). Verify, don't assume.
2. **Milestone gate.** Finish a milestone (or a part the user asks to see), play-test
   it yourself until you are satisfied, then **stop and hand over for the user's own
   test.** Only after they approve: **push to GitHub**, then start the next part.
   Never push untested/unapproved work. Commit locally as you go (small, descriptive
   commits).
3. **"Let's discuss" means discuss.** Do not build anything the user marked "let's
   discuss" in `FUTURE.md` until you have talked it through with them and agreed a
   design. Small clear bug reports can be fixed directly (say so in your report).
4. **`notes/TODO.md` is the live checklist.** Since 2026-09-24 it is pushed to GitHub
   (the user asked, for safety); commit it with the work. Keep it up to date LIVE
   and in DETAIL: a "Right now" line at the top, `[~]` for the item in progress, and
   sub-steps added and ticked as each small piece lands, not only when a whole
   feature is done. The user opens it at any time to see exactly where the work is.
5. **`notes/MASTER_PROMPT.md` (this file) is pushed too** (since 2026-09-24).
6. **Autonomous play-test-and-fix loop.** Play the game yourself with the automated
   play-test (section 5), find problems, fix them, re-test, and only stop when
   everything you can find is fixed or you truly need the user's input. The user does
   not want to be the tester for things you can detect yourself.
7. **Report format at hand-over:** (a) what you could not test, (b) what is done,
   (c) the next step. Plain language; the user is not a professional developer.
   Screenshots from `_shots/` are welcome.
8. **Assets:** CC0 packs are approved (credit them in `CREDITS.md`; keep source zips in
   `assets_src/`, which is gitignored; copy only used files into `FindingNaresh/`). The
   user wants to **agree on the look of every new asset before it is populated** into
   the world (FUTURE item 19) — show them first. Blender use must be discussed first.
9. **Commit attribution:** use only attribution that truthfully reflects the
   contributor and follows your environment's instructions.
10. Don't spawn sub-agents unless the user asks.
11. **Keep the notes current at every step, not only at part ends** (user, 2026-09-24:
    a thread can stop at any moment and the next one must carry on seamlessly).
    - Before starting a task: write it in `notes/TODO.md` "Right now" and mark it `[~]`.
    - After every finished sub-step or test run: tick it, add the result (pass/fail,
      numbers, what was fixed) and what comes next.
    - Every time a part is finished and tested: also update sections 2, 4, 6 and 7
      here, and add any hard-won lesson to section 7.
    - Commit locally often (small commits), so an unfinished change is always either
      committed or visible in `git status` / `git diff` for the next thread.
    - Pushing still follows rule 2 (only approved work), except when the user asks
      to push the notes.
12. **Test runs must not disturb the user** (they watch videos / work meanwhile): use
    `tools/run_test.sh` (window behind all others, focus handed back, muted).
13. **Professional process** (`DESIGN.md` section 6): design first, a gym (test map)
    per mechanic, then greybox in the world, automated tests, dev menu, 144 fps budget.
14. **Working mode while the user is away (user, 2026-09-26):** build the
    milestones one after another. For each: build, play-test until clean
    (Quick after each part, Full at the end), write
    `notes/TEST_MILESTONE_<X>.md` (a step-by-step checklist for the user,
    like `TEST_MILESTONE_D.md`: what to do, what should happen, what to
    report, plus "Decisions to confirm"), **push** (allowed in this mode),
    then start the next milestone. Open design questions: use the
    provisional answers in section 6 and list them for review. **If the
    user sends a message, go back to rule 2** (one milestone at a time, their
    approval before pushing). Their reports on earlier milestones come first.

15. **The polish list, `notes/POLISH.md`** (user, 2026-09-26): changes the
    user has agreed but wants left until every milestone is built. Don't
    build them during the milestones; add to the list whenever the user
    agrees something "for later"; **remind the user of it when all the
    milestones are done, or whenever they ask.**
16. **Lessons, written as you learn them (user, 2026-09-27):** every big
    lesson (a bug's real cause, a testing mistake, a design insight from the
    user's play, a Godot trap) goes into `notes/LESSONS.md` **at once**, not
    at the end of a milestone or a full test run: a thread can be compacted or
    stop at any moment. Before leaving a milestone or a thread, go through
    the work and add what's missing.
18. **Work from first principles (user, 2026-09-27):** `notes/PRINCIPLES.md`.
    Break a problem down, test the assumption with the smallest experiment,
    then decide; never assume a limit (speed, cost) you haven't measured.
    Build in `../MPG_dev` (a git worktree) while long tests run in `MPG`.
17. **At the end of each milestone, stop and ask (user, 2026-09-27):**
    "continue in this thread, or shall I prepare the hand-over notes for a
    new one?" Don't start the next milestone unasked. In the polishing stage,
    when the user gives a task, first give a quick recommendation (from how
    much of this thread's context is used and how big the task is) on
    whether to do it here or in a new thread, to save their tokens.
19. **Remember mistakes (user, 2026-10-02):** every time an assumption meets
    a different reality, write *assumed -> reality -> fix -> habit* in the
    mistake log in `notes/ROUGH_NOTES.md` at once; read it before starting
    something similar. Every learning goes in the rough notes as it happens.
20. **"Update the md files" (user, 2026-10-02)** means every file listed in
    `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` ("Remember mistakes...") that the change
    touches, including the user's skill `first-principles-solving` (general
    lessons only) and `AGENTS.md` for GPT and other models.
21. **Test by the watched run (user, 2026-10-02):** planned steps with
    expected outcomes, checked in parallel inside the game, stop on the first
    failure, resume from that step's save point; don't stop to check steps
    that worked (`notes/TESTING_METHOD.md`).

## 5. The automated play-test (your main tool)

- **Test levels (user, 2026-09-26), like a professional team:** while fixing,
  run only the scenarios for the change (`tools/run_test.sh a,b`, seconds to
  a minute or two); then **smoke** (`tools/run_test.sh`, ~2.5 min: base gym
  controls + one short world check per system); an **area set** when a whole
  area changed (`set:opening / gyms / puzzles / creatures / driving / world`,
  3-6 min each); **full** (`tools/run_test.sh full`) before a push or a
  hand-over, and GitHub runs full on every push. Don't rerun the opening or
  the long playthroughs for an unrelated fix. The plans live in
  `tools/test_plan.sh` (shared with the headless runner); `SMOKE_GYM` /
  `SMOKE_WORLD` in `PlayTest.gd`.
- **Resume (user, 2026-09-27):** a run that broke off (crash, hang killed by
  `TIMEOUT`, default 3600 s per game process, closed window, restart) goes on
  with `tools/run_test.sh resume`: PlayTest writes each finished scenario and
  its failures to `appdata/playtest/runs/progress.txt` (`--progress=`), a
  resumed segment skips those and carries their failures; finished segments
  are skipped. A failing segment no longer stops the run; one summary at the
  end (`runs/summary.txt`, logs `runs/seg_N.log`), SCRIPT ERRORs reported.
  Starting any other run clears the progress. Scenarios named on the command line run in
  the `all` list's order, not the order typed; the window
  starts at the screen edge, then PlayTest moves it BEHIND all windows and hands focus
  back (run_test.sh passes the user's window as --refocus); muted unless focused, no
  mouse grab. The user asked for this: runs must not cover what they are doing, but
  they can click the window to watch. `SHOW=1` shows it on screen. Output lines start with `[test]` (`PASS`/`FAIL`, logs,
  `shot test_x.png`). Screenshots land in `FindingNaresh/_shots/test_*.png`; view them.
- It drives the REAL input path (`Input.parse_input_event`): keys, mouse, a simulated
  gamepad on device 0; a physical P2 pad can also be connected. Add a scenario
  as `func t_<name>()` in `PlayTest.gd` and add the
  name to the `all` list in `_run()`. Helpers: `tap(KEY_X)`, `key(k, down)`, `mouse()`,
  `pad_axis()`, `pad_button()`, `wait()`, `physics_frames()`, `place_player()`,
  `face_point(p, target, dist, side)`, `van_to(poi)`, `reset_camper(i)`,
  `seat_p1_driver()`, `reset_can(tag, litres)`, `AutoDriver` (keyboard auto-driving
  along a Route; `boot.builder.network.chain([...])` makes a path), `check(ok, what)`,
  `shot(tag)`.
- Every scenario starts via `fresh_hands()` (empty hands, map/journal closed). Order
  matters: `map` runs early because others reveal the map. The `save` scenario reloads
  the scene; the test resumes in `t_save_verify` through static `PlayTest.resume`.
- **(Superseded 2026-09-26 by the levels above.)** Three test levels (2026-09-25): Quick (default, ~4.5 min): basic
  input/vehicle checks in the base gym, then world map, story, water works,
  carrying, controller, performance and save/load by teleport. Road check:
  `python tools/gen/layout_check.py`, ~2 s, when roads or hills change. Full:
  `tools/run_test.sh full`, ~33.5 min (gym, old broad suite, `journey`, all
  eight routes), when roads change and before a milestone hand-over.
- On this Windows PC, invoke
  `tools/run_test.sh` through Git Bash, capture the output to a log, and keep
  only one game instance running. Read the `[test]` PASS/FAIL lines and the
  final failure count; Godot warnings on stderr can make a PowerShell pipeline
  report exit code 1 even when the suite passes. The script now exits nonzero
  if any test check fails.
- **Real input leaks in** only with `SHOW=1` (quiet runs never get focus); if a check
  fails spuriously, re-run that scenario. Re-run single scenarios to
  confirm before chasing a failure. Tell the user when long runs are going.
- New `class_name` scripts need `tools/run_game.sh --headless --import` once before
  they can be referenced, otherwise "Identifier not declared".
- **Headless (Linux / GitHub, since 2026-09-24):** `tools/run_test_headless.sh
  [scenarios]` runs the same play-test with no window or GPU, `--fixed-fps 60`
  (deterministic: every frame is one 1/60 s physics step), Quick by default.
  Screenshots are skipped and frame-rate / audio checks only logged
  (`PlayTest.headless`). GitHub runs it plus the road check on every push
  (`.github/workflows/playtest.yml`). Use it for logic; keep `tools/run_test.sh`
  for looks, sound and fps. The headless script requires a Linux Godot binary;
  this Windows PC uses the windowed script locally and GitHub runs the Linux job.
- Also available: `-- --shot` (old capture mode); `t_overview` (top-down orthographic
  map shots) and `t_tour` (landmark screenshots) are great for checking world changes.
- **Connected-pad windowed runs:** the `layout` test now handles P2's physical
  controller and restores the initial view layout before `pad`. If the Godot
  window is minimized, physics stops and the suite can appear to hang; restore
  it behind other windows before diagnosing a test timeout. Automated pad events
  verify actions but cannot establish whether a mechanic feels fun.

## 6. What to do next

**Milestones A-E are approved and pushed. Next, in this order:**

0. **Milestone F, the return** (`notes/TODO.md`, `design/RETURN.md`,
   `DESIGN.md`). RETURN.md's questions were answered on 2026-10-01 (its
   "Decisions" section: storm road a dead end, the dishes point at nearer
   return sites, the family silent, the tracker without the batteries).
   F is split into F1-F9 in TODO.md (F1 the storm gym first), one part at
   a time with the user's test before each push. **F1 (`world/Storm.gd`,
   `--gym=storm`, `t_storm_gym`) is approved and pushed (2026-10-01).
   F2 (the storm on the old road: `StormFront` zone + `Storm`, the power
   line down, `LiftBridge.storm_blow`, `t_storm_road`) is approved and pushed
   (2026-10-01).** F3 (`world/FishingVillage.gd`, R1 the decoy, the refuel
   mistake, `Creature.on_return`, `t_decoy`, `t_decoy_save`, `set:return`)
   is pushed (2026-10-01) but **not yet tested by the user**. F4-F9 are
   built and merged into main locally (not pushed): F4 `world/SaltPans.gd`,
   F5 `puzzles/SwingBridge.gd`, F6 `world/RailTunnel.gd` +
   `items/FlareGun.gd` + the van's bump start, F7 `puzzles/RadioMast.gd`,
   F8 `world/Homecoming.gd`, F9 `t_return_run` (+ `Camper._safety_net`, the
   estuary bridge's ramps). Tests: `set:return`, `return_run` in full.
   **Waiting for the user's test from F3 on** (`notes/TEST_MILESTONE_F.md`),
   then push; then Milestone G (remind the user of `notes/POLISH.md`).
   **Before that (user, 2026-10-02): walk the test sheet F3-F8 blind**
   (real input only, nothing set in code) with the new closed-loop way of
   testing: a live control line into the running game (`notes/ROUGH_NOTES.md`,
   `notes/TODO.md`). Every learning goes into `notes/ROUGH_NOTES.md` at once.
   **Mode for the rest of F (user, 2026-10-01):** build F4-F9 with the
   recommended answers (each part's "Decisions to confirm" in
   `notes/TEST_MILESTONE_F.md`); the user tests once F is finished, from F3
   on; keep new parts local in main until then (no push). Then F4 (the salt pans) in
   `../MPG_dev` on a new branch from main. Build the next part in
   `../MPG_dev` while the long runs go in `MPG`. After all milestones,
   remind the user of `notes/POLISH.md`.
   (Old note: `../MPG_dev` was on branch `e7` at the start of F: start F
   there on a new branch from main (`git -C ../MPG_dev switch -c f1 main`).
1. Then Milestone G (`notes/TODO.md`, `DESIGN.md`). New mechanics each get
   a gym first. The design pages (`design/*.md`) are proposals until their
   open questions are answered by the user; the answered ones have a
   "Decisions" section (WAY_OUT, CREATURES, BESSI, NARESH).
2. At the end of every milestone: the full run, push, then ask the user
   "continue in this thread, or shall I prepare the hand-over notes for a
   new one?"

## 7. Hard-won technical lessons (don't relearn these)

- **Input** is polled in `Boot._physics_process` (before players/van read it); quick
  taps are latched from events in `InputDevice.feed_event`. Polling per render frame
  lost taps at 144 Hz. The dev machine: RTX 3060, 144 Hz 1080p.
- **Physics interpolation is on.** Cameras are placed in `PlayerRig._process` from
  `get_global_transform_interpolated()` and have interpolation OFF. Call
  `reset_physics_interpolation()` after every teleport.
- **Seated players are never reparented** into the van (it launched the van at
  19 000 km/h). They are snapped to seat markers each tick with collision off.
- **VehicleBody3D:** positive `engine_force` pushes this rig toward +Z, so drive forces
  are negated; `steering` is positive-left. **Handbrake model (user-approved):**
  `Camper.parking_brake` toggled by Space/pad B (driver or passenger), P lamp; it is the
  ONLY hold (no auto-hold): off = the van rolls on slopes, even with nobody in it.
  Throttle/reverse with the engine running releases it. With the engine off, S always
  brakes. A van stopped on the handbrake with wheels down is `freeze`d (raycast brakes
  creep). Tests must park with the handbrake (`reset_camper`/`van_to` set it) or the
  van rolls away mid-test (this once cascaded into 18 failures).
- **Terrain** is solved on a 5 m grid: roads and river are stamped segment-by-segment
  (distance + height), mesh is an ArrayMesh, collision is `HeightMapShape3D` (heights
  /STEP, shape scaled by STEP). World build ~1 s (it was 5.8 s with per-vertex nearest
  queries). `Landscape.ground(x,z)` = bilinear on the grid once built. Buildings need
  **pads** (`LevelBuilder.PADS`) or they sit on slopes.
- **Roads/river** follow `Landscape.base_height` (no roads/river) so they never chase
  their own cuts; junction heights are pinned; the road ribbon is omitted over the
  river (bridge decks carry it).
- **Label3D text faces +Z; `Basis.looking_at(t)` points -Z at t.** Signs had their text
  facing away from drivers until this was fixed — aim -Z *away* from the viewer.
- **Carryables**: held items are real bodies steered to a hold point low-right of the
  view; collision exception with the holder; a safety net returns anything that falls
  under the ground to its last resting spot (physics once shot a crate to y = -248).
  `pouring` tilts items at fillers — clear it on drop/throw.
- **CharacterBody**: keep the intended horizontal velocity (`_plan_vel`) rather than
  the post-collision velocity, or you can never jump onto a crate you are touching. A
  two-crate stack is a wall; climbing needs a staircase (1 crate, then 2).
- **Interactables**: metas on Area3D/bodies: `prompt`, `prompt_fn(player)`,
  `blocked_fn()` or `blocked_fn(player)`, `callback(player)`, `hold_fn(player, dt)`,
  and for held items `held_prompt_fn(player, item)` + `held_action(player, item, dt,
  first)` + `pour` flag. Hold-to-use continues while E is held and you stay within 3 m.
- **Editing files from the shell:** heredocs with backslashes and `\n` inside Python
  strings got mangled by the shell repeatedly. Write patch scripts with the file-write
  tool (Python with raw strings `r'''...'''` and `assert old in s` before replacing),
  run them, then delete them from `tools/`.
- **GDScript** can't infer types from Variant sources (`var x := dict["k"]`, `get_node`
  results, ternaries with untyped sides): give explicit types.
- **Godot editor** rewrites `project.godot` (drops comments/defaults) when the user
  opens it — that's fine.
- **Audio**: `Sfx.play3d(name, pos, db)` picks a random CC0 variant; `NoiseLoop` for
  procedural loops (silent ones push zero buffers, cheap). Looping imported WAVs: set
  `loop_mode`/`loop_end` on a duplicate at runtime. You cannot listen: verify sounds by
  state (playing, pitch, gain) in tests and ask for the user's ears. CC0 sources that
  worked: Kenney packs, OpenGameArt (check each page's licence; curl into
  `assets_src/`; `C:/Windows/System32/tar.exe` extracts .7z). Pillow and numpy exist in
  the system Python; do NOT pip install (C: drive rule).
- **Camera far plane** is 2600 m (backdrop ridges); fog ends at 1500 m.
- **Players knocked by the van**: `PlayerRig.knock(impulse, van)` (collision exception
  until clear); `Camper._check_pedestrians` detects just ahead of the hull, because a
  kinematic player would stop the van dead.
- **Split-screen shots**: `shot()` captures the window. With no connected pad,
  solo view shows the keyboard owner's view and TAB swaps the keyboard/view.
  With P2 on a pad, TAB leaves the keyboard with P1; use a split layout to
  inspect both views.
- **Gyms**: GymBuilder must provide what other systems read from a builder: `network`,
  `route` (AutoDriver, reset_camper), `river` (MapState), `poi` ("homestead",
  "camper_spawn"), `camper_spawn`, `player_spawns`. Story and MapState skip their
  world-specific parts when `boot.gym != ""`. In gyms PlayTest runs only `["gym"]`.
- A van dropped onto a slope needs ~2 s to settle on its springs before it freezes;
  measure holds after that.
- **Mirrors are expensive**: every SubViewport camera re-renders the world incl.
  directional shadow cascades, with a fixed cost (far plane made no difference). All
  three every frame: 58 fps; one per frame: 109; one every 2nd frame: ~130. Any new
  render-to-texture (binoculars, CCTV, photo) must budget for this the same way.
- **Private visual layers**: layer `1 << (1 + i)` is masked out of player i's camera
  only. Use it to hide things from one player (own avatar, the nav when aside).
- Performance: ~130 fps with both views while driving (mirrors on); keep >= 120.
- **Terrain winding:** tile triangles are wound [a, a+1, c] so faces point up.
  The old [a, c, a+1] order made the double-sided material flip the normals: the
  ground was lit as if the sun were below it (flat sand looked dark khaki). The
  terrain albedo is 0.6 to keep the approved brightness under full sun.
- **Road profiles** (`Route` smooth_m/max_grade): the ground noise alone has ~20 %
  slopes, so roads blur the ground over 150 m and then clamp to 10 % (gravel 15,
  ghat 9); junction heights are the mean ground over a 50 m disk. Check a layout
  with `python tools/gen/layout_check.py` before building it.
- **Tunnels**: a road whose profile ignores a hill (height_fn minus that mound)
  gets `Route.tunnel` flags where the ground is > 9 m above it; the terrain is only
  cut as a narrow slot there (TUNNEL_FLAT/BLEND) and `_tunnel()` builds walls, a
  roof and earth fill over it. No heightmap holes needed.
- **Build time traps:** adding thousands of shapes to one body then reparenting
  them is O(n²) (scatter took 94 s); create per-tile bodies up front. The terrain
  grid solve pre-filters hills/lakes/pads per row (`_base_fast`).
- **World build speed (2026-09-24, cloud):** ~7.0 s -> ~4.7 s headless with the
  world bit-for-bit the same (hashes of the height/road/river grids, normals,
  colours, every tile mesh array and every scatter transform/colour/collider
  compared before and after). Noise factors per row/column (64-bit, same
  expression order), tile index lists shared, the scatter's grid lookups by
  hand, scatter colliders as shape owners instead of 59 000 CollisionShape3D
  nodes. Tried and dropped: filling MultiMeshes from one buffer (slower to
  build in script than the per-instance calls, and not measurable headless).
- **Headless runs:** `frame_post_draw` never fires (so `shot()` returns early),
  viewport textures are null, and MultiMesh instance transforms read back as
  zero (use `builder.scatter[...]`). Without `--fixed-fps` a slow CPU runs
  physics behind real-time waits and timing checks fail at random.
- **Mouse look reads `screen_relative`**, not `relative`: `relative` is scaled by
  the canvas_items stretch, so look speed changed with the window size.
- The coast blend must not leave a step at its inland edge (a line of "white
  dashes" in overhead shots was exactly that).
- **Full preset order:** save/load reloads the scene and ends the test process,
  so `routes` must run before `save`. The launcher runs the gym as a separate
  process before the world; do not overlap game instances.
- **Test helpers vs input latching:** `InputDevice.feed_event` latches every
  pressed event as a tap, so re-sending a held key each tick reads as 60 taps
  a second. `hold_physics` only re-sends a press that a focus change dropped,
  and waits 3 ticks after release (a pour holds the can at the filler until
  the release lands). Never edit PlayTest.gd while a run is going: later
  segments load the file fresh.
- **Teleporting players (`go_to`)**: cast down from just above the target's
  own height, or inside the house you land on the upper floor.
- **Driving into P2's drive:** the auto-driver's 8-12 m look-ahead cuts the
  90-degree corner onto the bank. Feed it a turning arc (9 m tangents) and a
  short look-ahead; check the van is on the slab (across < 1.4 m), not just
  near the house.
- **Walk, don't teleport, to find layout bugs:** `walk_to` turns the player
  and holds W tick by tick, logging and screenshotting where they get stuck.
  Teleport-based checks (`go_to`, `face_point`) passed while P2 could not get
  out of the house or onto the stairs. Every walkable space gets a walk test.
- **Terrain under narrow features:** the terrain grid is 5 m, so anything
  narrower (the 4.6 m drive) needs the terrain lowered at least one grid step
  either side, or the triangles between vertices poke through it.
- **Town traffic clearance:** the van is 2.24 m wide; cars sit 2.4 m off the
  centre and look ahead with a 1.8 m box, so a van down the middle passes.
- **Split HUD:** the top-left objective and top-centre fading controls
  overlapped in 800 px views. The controls now wrap at bottom right, clear of
  the gauges. Checked on foot and from both seats.
- **Class names must not clash with Godot's:** `class_name Noise` hid Godot's
  own `Noise`, every script using it failed to parse and the game hung on
  the parse error. It is `Hearing` now. Run tests under `timeout 300-400` and
  `taskkill //F //IM "Godot*"` afterwards, so a parse error can't hang a run.
- **Patch files, not heredocs:** bash heredocs mangled `·` and quotes in
  GDScript. Write a small Python patch script with the Write tool, read with
  `newline=''` and normalise CRLF (PlayerHUD.gd once had mixed endings).
  Never edit game scripts while a test run is going; new files are safe.
- **Long sequences in tests must be cancellable:** a running `Taken` sequence
  teleported P1 in the middle of later checks. `Taken.cancel()` and the
  "taken" group; `calm_creature()` cancels them and clears the creature's
  van interest. Timers that outlive a node: use a tween owned by the node,
  not `create_timer(...).connect(lambda)` (freed-lambda errors).
- **Creature tests:** place players off the cover pieces (a placement on the
  rock looked like "can't move"), flatten direction vectors before scaling
  them into distances, and remember a van settling on its springs at the
  start has a vertical speed (only horizontal speed counts as driving).
- **E while holding the box means "get under it":** toss it with G/LMB to
  put it down.
- **Contact callbacks report the speed after the bounce:** `body_entered`
  on a RigidBody gives the already-slowed velocity. A thrown item carries a
  `_thrown` flag so its first landing is always loud.
- **Things left lying around make tests flaky:** a tossed box between the
  rock and the creature hid the peeking player one run in three. Tests put
  such items back where they belong before the next check.
- **Interactables need a `prompt` meta**: `PlayerRig._find_interactable` walks up
  to the first node with `prompt`; `prompt_fn` alone is ignored (the ladder was
  unusable). **Story steps by id**, never by number (`Story.index_of`): adding
  the windmill step shifted a hard-coded `index >= 5`. Named scenarios outside
  the `all` list run after `save`, which reloads the scene, so they never run:
  add new world scenarios to `all` before `save`.
- **Background runs and edits:** a Quick run in the background still loads
  later segments fresh, so editing any game script while it runs spoils it.
  Check `tasklist | grep -i godot` before editing; write only new files then.
- **Untyped builder:** `boot.builder` is untyped in PlayTest, so `var x :=
  boot.builder.foo...` is a parse error that stops the whole world segment
  (0 passes): give such variables a type.
- **Python patches through bash heredocs:** `"\n"` in a GDScript string
  didn't match; use the Edit tool for lines with backslash escapes.
- **`Route.nearest` only searches the hash cells round the point:** for a
  place well off a road (the coast tower, 40 m) it can return a far sample.
  Scan the road's points by hand for "nearest bit of road to X".
- **Checks must be tight enough to fail:** "higher than deck - 0.6 m" passed
  while the lookout ramp stopped short of every deck. Check the exact thing
  (feet on the deck, within its footprint).
- **Pretend pads leak between scenarios:** tests that call
  `boot._on_joy_changed(0, true)` leave P2 on a pad; `_run` now calls
  `_unplug_test_pad()` after each scenario (skipped when a real pad is in).
- **Tests must find things the way a player does:** `t_relay` set
  `has_binoculars = true`, so nobody noticed the binoculars were never placed
  in the world. Pick items up with the real keys where the test can.
- **Tests set up their own state:** the smoke order runs tests in a new
  sequence and exposed ones that leaned on what came before (the story's spare
  can skipped once the dev menu's fix filled the tank; the pad test couldn't
  start an engine an earlier drive had overheated). Each scenario sets what
  it needs (`camper().repair_all()`, the fuel, the story index).
- **A real controller plugged in changes the tests:** P2 goes onto it and TAB
  leaves the keyboard with P1. The opening scenarios put P2 on the keyboard
  first (`_p2_on_keyboard`); check `pads=` on the first log line.
- **A failing gym segment stops the Quick run** (`|| exit`), so later
  segments don't run at all: read which segment failed, fix, and rerun Quick.
  (Superseded: since the resume work a failing segment no longer stops the run.)
- **A freed object reads as null:** `job_target != null and not
  is_instance_valid(job_target)` never fired once the target was freed
  (Godot 4 compares a freed object equal to null). Keep a flag that there
  was a target (`Naresh._has_target`).
- **Stowing from someone's hands:** `Carryable.stow` lets go through each
  holder's `drop_held()`; setting `held = null` first skipped the release and
  the item kept its holder (nobody could pick it up again). Release, then
  stow (`Naresh._stow`).
- **Label3D `fixed_size`:** `pixel_size` then means screen size: 0.0006 at
  font 48 gives ~17 px letters at any distance (0.0011 at 96 was ~60 px).
  `offset` is in those pixels too; `visibility_range_begin` hides it close up.
- **Naresh's debug lines:** `[naresh] <state> -> <state>`, job steps and job
  ends are printed to the log; tests also log what he says.
- **A story jump must set up the world, not just the objective:** each
  Bessi step's flags are set / cleared in `Story._bessi_state_for`, the
  groups `roses`, `evidence`, `bessi_tasks`, `storm_front` get
  `match_story`, and `DevMenu.go_to_step` moves both players, Naresh and the
  van there. A new story step needs a row in `STEP_PLACES` and in
  `t_step_jumps`.
- **World tests pass alone but fail in order** when an earlier one leaves
  state behind (the lorry gone, a can on the rack, a running engine): each
  test resets what it uses (`Roses.reset()`, `Lorry.reset()`, `engine_on()`
  rather than toggling).
- **A tilted collider wedges a character:** keep pushable things' colliders
  upright; a stuck Naresh falls back to grid A* (`_force_grid`).
- **Two game instances at once are fine here** (112 vs 144 fps); the NVIDIA
  driver still crashes now and then on long runs (nvoglv64.dll): resume.

## 8. Resuming in a new thread

Read the files listed at the top, check `git status` / `git log -3` (and `git diff` if
anything is uncommitted: that is the last thread's unfinished work), read
`notes/TODO.md`'s "Right now" and the `[~]` items, tell the user in two or three plain
lines where things stand and what you will do next, then continue from exactly there
(section 6 for the order). Do not redo finished items. From then on follow rule 11:
keep `notes/TODO.md` and this file current after every step, so the thread after you
can resume the same way.
